Welcome to the Pynamic Gain documentation!
==========================================


Introduction
------------

Pynamic Gain is a Python package that facilitates the creation and analysis of **Dynamic Gain** calculations across multiple distributed setups. It serves three main purposes:

* **Distributed setup management**: Maintain an overview of setups and seeds used to ensure reproducibility and uniqueness of stimuli across multiple setups.
* **Create Input Stimuli**: Create input stimuli for subsequent dynamic gain calculation.
* **Online Analysis**: Perform real-time analysis of stimulated recordings to identify appropriate analysis windows for dynamic gain calculation.

In the future, this package will also include the dynamic gain calculation itself.
